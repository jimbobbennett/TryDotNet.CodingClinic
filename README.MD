# Coding Clinic using Try .Net

This repo is a quick play with [Try .Net](https://github.com/dotnet/try) to see how easy it would be to port the [Coding Clinic](https://coding.clinic).

## To run this

* Clone this repo.

* Install the global [dotnet try tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-try/):
  
  ```sh
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-try --version 1.0.19266.1
  ```

* Run DotNetTry:
  
  ```sh
  dotnet try
  ```

This will launch this document in your browser.

> This will only work using Try .NET, clicking this link from GitHub will not give you a page that can run code.
